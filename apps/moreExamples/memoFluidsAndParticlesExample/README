This is not the full code for the glastonbury app as that is quite complex, multi-threaded, using 6 cameras + 6 projectors etc. Instead I've simplified it a bit (removed some messy multithreaded stuff and the osc/midi triggering based on camera - you can find quartz composer and processing.org source code for that on this site anyway).

for more info and the installation behind the example: http://www.memo.tv/source_code_for_fluid_solver_optical_flow_particles

with ofx-dev the example should build fine and work well without changes from the website..

 
here are the changes i made for compiling this example with the ofx-dev bundle:

	diff --git a/addons/ofxOpenCv/src/ofxCvGrayscaleImage.cpp b/addons/ofxOpenCv/src/ofxCvGrayscaleImage.cpp
	+void ofxCvGrayscaleImage::thresholdMSA( int value, int type) {         // MSA
	+       cvThreshold( cvImage, cvImageTemp, value, 255, type ); swapTemp();
	+}

	diff --git a/addons/ofxOpenCv/src/ofxCvGrayscaleImage.h b/addons/ofxOpenCv/src/ofxCvGrayscaleImage.h
	+       void thresholdMSA( int value, int type = CV_THRESH_BINARY); // MSA
