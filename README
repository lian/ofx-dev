## What?
openframeworks - unofficial 006 - Development-Bundle

"tinkering with openframeworks at it's early release stage!"

## todo

-
split this huge (100m+) repository, make it a virtual base-package with addons and
examples as submodules. this should open the ability for everyone to just fork add
app/addon-repos in his personal branch or share it with friends, more lightweight.

-
cross plattform build-helpers, build/package automation..

-
autotest/unittest core, opencv-addon (gmock?), benchmarking..

-
more updated windows examples and build-files..


## current-status (before split into submodules)

   - libs/openFrameworks frequently updated oF's subversion, check git-log or gitk
   - libs/* => of_preRelease_v0.06_[osx|linux|win32]_FAT
